## 🚀 Deployment

This project is configured for automatic deployment to a Vultr VPS using GitHub Actions. The blog is served at `/blog` subpath.

### Quick Start

1. **Configure GitHub Secrets** (see below)
2. **Merge to `main`** — Release Please opens/updates one Release PR
3. **Merge the Release PR** — publishes a GitHub Release and auto-deploys
4. **Or manual trigger** — Use GitHub Actions UI (`Deploy Blog to Vultr`)

### Deployment Features

- ✅ **Zero-downtime deployments** - Atomic symlink swaps
- ✅ **Release-based strategy** - Each deployment creates a timestamped release
- ✅ **Automatic rollback support** - Previous releases kept for easy rollback
- ✅ **Health checks** - Automatic verification after deployment
- ✅ **Cleanup** - Old releases automatically removed (keeps last 5)

### Required GitHub Secrets

Configure the following secrets in your GitHub repository:

**Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository secret**

- `SSH_HOST` - VPS IP address or hostname
- `SSH_USER` - SSH username (usually `root` or a deploy user)
- `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY` - SSH private key (PEM format)
- `SSH_PORT` - SSH port (optional, defaults to 22)
- `RELEASE_BOT_TOKEN` - PAT used by Release Please and version sync (must be allowed to create PRs, tags, and releases)

### Workflow Steps

The deployment workflow consists of 5 jobs:

1. **🔍 Lint Code** - Runs ESLint to check code quality
2. **🏗️ Build Blog** - Builds the Astro site and creates deployment archive
3. **🚀 Deploy to Vultr** - Uploads and deploys to server with zero downtime
4. **✅ Verify Deployment** - Checks deployment and performs health check
5. **📊 Deployment Summary** - Generates summary report

### Nginx Configuration

Configure your Nginx server block for `www.sewwa.com` to serve the blog at the root:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name www.sewwa.com;
    root /var/www/sewwa.com/html;
    index index.html;
    
    # Serve static files
    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
    }
    
    # Cache static assets
    location ~* \.(js|css|png|jpg|jpeg|gif|ico|svg|woff|woff2|ttf|eot)$ {
        expires 1y;
        add_header Cache-Control "public, immutable";
    }
}
```

After configuring, restart Nginx:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```
