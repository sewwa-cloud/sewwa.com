We just added a visual color picker to the [CSS Color Converter & Variable Tool](https://www.sewwa.com/color-palette). Now you can select colors with your mouse instead of typing them manually.

## What's New

The color picker appears at the top of the input section and lets you:

- Pick colors visually using a color wheel
- Adjust transparency with a slider
- Choose between HEX, RGB, or HSL formats
- Add colors to your input with one click

## Why It Matters

Before this feature, you had to:
1. Copy color codes from design tools
2. Paste them into the text area
3. Hope you didn't make typos

Now it's just: point, click, add.

## Try It Out

Visit [https://www.sewwa.com/color-palette](https://www.sewwa.com/color-palette) and you'll see the color picker above the text input. Select a color, choose your format, and hit the plus button.
