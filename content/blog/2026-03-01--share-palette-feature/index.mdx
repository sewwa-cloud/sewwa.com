Ever wanted to send a palette to a teammate, client, or friend without screenshots or messy exports?

We've added a **Share Palette** feature so you can share any palette with a single link. Turn it on, copy the URL, and anyone can view your colors and grab the CSS variables — no account needed on their end.

## ✨ How It Works

If you're logged in, you'll see a **Share link** toggle right next to the Save button when you're viewing a palette.

- **Toggle on** → Your palette gets a public URL (e.g. `sewwa.com/color-palette/p/my-awesome-palette`)
- **Toggle off** → The link stops working; your palette is private again
- **Share icon** → When the toggle is on, a purple share icon appears. Click it to copy the link to your clipboard

It's that simple. You control when a palette is shareable.

## 🔗 What Recipients See

When someone opens your share link, they get a clean, read-only view of your palette:

- **Palette name** and color count
- **Color strip preview** at the top
- **Individual color cards** with:
  - Large color swatch
  - Semantic name and CSS variable
  - HEX, RGB, and HSL values with copy buttons
- **CSS Variables section** with tabs for HEX, RGB, and HSL — one click to copy the full block

No login, no clutter. Just your palette, ready to use.
